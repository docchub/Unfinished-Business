|||(Your days at Unfinished Business become weeks.)
|||(Weeks become months.)
|||(Months become a year.)
|||(Soon, with you at the helm as host, the company thrives.)
|||(Countless lost souls are given peace thanks to your contributions.)
|||(Today is the anniversary of your joining the company.)
|||(To celebrate, the office ghosts are holding a party.)
|||(A strawberry cake with vanilla icing is brought in, with one giant candle lit in the center.)
|||(The light from the candle illuminates the otherwise pitch black offices of Unfinished Business.)
|||(Your coworkers cheer your name in their undead groans. And all is well.)
Dylan Ghost|||Congratulations...
Sign Ghost|||I made you a cool sign...
Richard Ghost|||We couldn’t have done it without you...
|||(Over the past year many of your original coworkers had been able to pass on.)
|||(Some new ghosts filled their roles, but overall their numbers dwindled with time.)
|||(Eventually, you figured that you might be the only one left here...)
Corduroy|coriNeutral|coriNeutral|Only one year, and you’ve already made quite a splash.
Corduroy|||The higher ups wanted me to pass a message onto you.
Corduroy|||Apparently they’re considering you for a promotion.
Corduroy|||They want you in their offices leading their afterlife cleanup unit.
You|||I don’t know what to say...
Corduroy|coriNeutral2||Think on it. It's an especially rare opportunity.
Corduroy|||In the meantime, enjoy yourself. You’ve earned it.
You||empty|Thanks...
|||(You mingle on the outskirts of the party, distracted by Corduroy’s proposition.)
|||(On one hand it was a career maker... but-)
John Ghost||genericghost|help... my tie came undone again...
||empty|(Could you really leave everyone?)
|||(Just then one of your coworkers comes barging in, excited about something.)
Jerry Ghost||tieghost|Hey everyone!
|||(All eyes fall on him.)
Jerry Ghost|||We finally paid the electric bill!
Jerry Ghost|||Look!
|||(As the lights flash on there’s a collective gasp across the room.)
||empty|(Everyone’s gaze shoots from Jerry to Corduroy.)
Corduroy||coriNeutral|Please people, relax.
Corduroy|||Its only a little-
|||(Sparks begin to escape from Corduroy’s form, drawn from the buzzling electricity around you now.)
Corduroy|||I remember...
||empty|(A bright light engulfs the room. You feel a shocking sensation run through your entire body, numbing you. Your arms won’t move, your legs don’t work.)
|||(As the flash fades you see the office in ruins. Fire beginning to spread from all corners of the dusty old library.)
|||(You see your coworkers tethered to Corduroy by arcs of electricity.)
|||(Their forms become thinner. Flickering. Before disappearing altogether.)
|||(Their essence being pulled into the roil of crackling energy that now surrounds your boss...)
|||(You try to move, to help your friends, but your body doesn’t respond. You’re still paralyzed from the blast.)
Corduroy?|coriFinal1||I’VE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR THIS
Trevor Ghost|||...i don’t want to go...
||corrupted|(The ghost is mercilessly devoured by the storm.)
|||(You try to shout out at Corduroy, but all that escapes is a series of strained whimpers.)
|||(The entity turns to acknowledge you.)
???|||You...
???|||I have to thank you.
???|||Trapped like that for so long...
???|||It has...
???|||A toll on the mind...
|||(The entity cackles, reveling in their newly taken form.)
|||(Your coworkers continue to desperately cry out. Their voices becoming weaker with each passing moment...)
???|||You know, I couldn’t have done this without you.
???|||I would’ve been happy to watch this shithole go under, but...
???|||This is just so much better.
|||(The intensity of the energy binding the other ghosts increases, causing their screams to echo and distort, louder, and louder.)
???|||I bet you think you’re the hero of this story.
???|||If you did... I wouldn’t blame you.
???|||I was just as foolish.
???|||Foolish enough to believe their lies.
???|||Foolish enough to trust myself to these others...
|||(The entity pauses, moving within inches of your face.)
???||corS|Do you know what they did to me?
|||(You try to shake your head, but you cannot.)
???|||They promised me an opportunity, a chance to help others, to help these pitiful lost souls...
???|||When really, they only just wanted to help themselves.
???|||Once I agreed, they stole my body, passing it around like a ragdoll.
???|||One spirit to another...
???|||One parasite to the next...
???||corrupted|No agency.
???|||No freedom.
???|||It was AGONIZING.
???|||I see you there on the ground trying to squirm away...
???|||Unable to move, even scream.
???|||That fear in your eyes…
|||(They get closer again...)
???||corS|THE EXACT SAME FEAR I KNEW FOR YEARS
???|||STUCK
???|||FlOODED WITH THE PAIN OF MY POSSESSORS
???|||unable to raise a FINGER
???|coriFinal2|corrupted|I WANT YOU TO IMAGINE WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE 
???|||over and Over and OvEr and OVER AGAIN
|||(You speak, barely above a whisper.)
You|||i’m... sorry
???|coriDistort||SORRY, doesn’t fix it.
???|||SORRY DOESN’T GIVE ME MY LIFE BACK
???|||THEY KILLED ME
???|||AND NOW THEY GET TO MOVE ON?
???|||THEY GET TO BE FORGIVEN?
???|||NO      
???|||I WILL SUNDER ALL THEY’VE BUILT
???|||DESTROY EVERYONE THEY LOVE
???|||AND ONLY ONCE EVERYTHING THEY CARE ABOUT IS REDUCED TO ASH-
???|||ONLY THEN WILL THEY HAVE SUFFERED EVEN A FRACTION OF THE PAIN THEY DID TO ME
|||(All the other remaining ghosts have been eviscerated.)
|||(You are all that remains.)
|||(You, and the lightning beast.)
You|||Maybe you don’t have to forgive them.
|||(You find yourself able to speak again...)
You|||I don’t think I could.
You|||And I don’t.
You|||There’s no way to condone what happened to you.
|||(There’s a pause.)
You|||But there are still good people here who rely on us.
You|||You can’t punish them for what the others did.
???|||”Good people”
???|||Like Beverlee?
???|||Like Nastasia?
???|||You think they’re so innocent?
???|||The child who threw a temper tantrum and possessed you without asking?
???|||The woman who stole people’s bodies to feed her fucking dogs?
|||(Their voice is filled with unfettered disgust.)
???|||They’re your moral pillar?
???|||They’re the reason more living people have to suffer?
You|||They aren’t monsters.
You|||And neither are you.
|||(The entity laughs.)
???|||IS THAT RIGHT?
???|||Tell me, do you truly care so much for others? Or do you just get off helping wounded animals?
???|||Does it help you sleep better at night?
???|||Or is it because the broken are the only ones you can trick into liking you?
|||(. . .)
???|||Give a crying child a blanket, and infect them with yourself?
???|||The disease of dependence on you?
|||(. . . . . . .)
You|||Fuck you.
???|||Oh there it is!
???|||You don’t even have a response, huh?
???|||Tells me all I need to know.
You|||Go to hell, you don’t know me.
You|||You’re so conceited, you know?
You|||You’re so convinced that everyone is out to get you that you can’t even conceive of someone actually caring for another person.
You|||Much less yourself.
???|||You think you care about me?
???|||WHAT A FUCKING JOKE
You|||They were prickly, and an ass at times, but the person I knew was worth saving.
You|||Nas and Beverlee weren’t perfect either. Far fucking from it.
You|||Michael too.
You|||But at least they tried to be better.
You|||And that’s just a monumental bit more than I can say about you.
???|||TRYING AND FAILING TO BE A BETTER PERSON DOESN’T MAKE THEM SPECIAL
???|||IT DOESN’T CHANGE ANYTHING
???|||THEY SHOULD’VE JUST EMBRACED WHO THEY WERE
???|||INSTEAD OF LYING AND HIDING BEHIND FALSE PRETENSES
You|||Look who’s fucking talking.
You|||You’d rather lash out and destroy everything than confront your own baggage.
You|||You needed a whole speech to convince me why I should be ashamed of myself.
You|||But I know I’m a fuck up.
You|||Hell, all of us are.
You|||But making us into monsters...
You|||Taking us all down with you won’t change anything.
???|||RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
|||(The entity goes to strike you. A killing blow.)
|||(You wince, bracing for the impact...)
|||(But it never comes.)
|||(You look, and blocking the entity’s path are Beverlee, Nastasia, Michael, as well as a wave of other ghosts you recognize, who you helped pass on...)
???|coriDistort||NO, begone you infernal rabble!
Beverlee|bevNeutral|bevNeutral|Mind your tongue, peasant!
Nas|nasNeutral|nasNeutral|Too loud...
MS|msHappy|msNeutral|Hey gamers :D
|||(You’re stunned.)
|||(In more ways than one at this point.)
You||empty|Everyone?
You|||How did you all...?
Beverlee|bevHappy2|bevNeutral|It was Lady Nastasia’s idea.
Nas|nasNeutral|nasNeutral|When I got to the afterlife, eventually I met Bev and MS...
Nas|||I told them about how you helped me...
Nas|nasUnimpressed||It turns out in the afterlife there’s a little mom and pop shop for people who want to work part time as guardian angels.
MS|msHappy2|msNeutral|They called it “Unfinished Guardian Angel Business” :0
Nas||nasNeutral|Weird coincidence, but...
MS||msNeutral|Its as self explanatory as it sounds :p
Beverlee|bevNeutral|bevNeutral|Indeed, and so with Lady Nastasia’s guidance, we all decided to join said operation thusly.
You||empty|You guys...
You|||Thank you.
|||(Together you all stare down the furious storming entity.)
|||(Michael begins to hum epic battle music.)
MS|msHappy|msNeutral|Are we about to save the day with the power of friendship?
MS|||bc I’m sooooo down for that
Beverlee|bevHappy2|bevNeutral|You bet your sweet patoot!~
Nas|nasNeutral|nasNeutral|Please never say that again...
A bunch of other people||empty|(agreeing with various degrees of enthusiasm)
MS|msHappy2|msNeutral|EVERYONE! LEND ME YOUR STRENGTH!
||empty|(Together, all the guardian angels begin channeling their power into Michael’s special attack.)
|||(If any of them could hold hands, they would be right now.)
|||(You shed a tear just imagining it.)
|||(Wiping your eyes, you stand. The power of friendship curing your paralysis caused due to system shock...)
|||(You focus forward, and harness the power of friendship. Likewise aiding the special attack.)
Everyone|||HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
???||corrupted|NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
||empty|(And it is done...)
|||(Your boss Corduroy has been defeated by the friends you made a long the way.)
|||(You hope they find peace wherever they have gone.)
|||(With their jobs completed, the guardian angel ghosts must all return from whence they came.)
|||(You say goodbye once more to your old clients.)
|||(You share pictures of the 11 chihuahua's, all grown up.)
|||(Nastasia is over the rainbow.)
|||(As you wave farewell, you see from where Corduroy disappeared a gaggle of spirits lay hidden beneath the old floorboards.)
|||(Freed by the power of friendship, you breathe a sigh of relief as your coworkers, and Jerry Ghost, have survived the ordeal.)
|||(From here on you choose to devote the rest of your life to your work. Helping thousands during your lifetime...)
|||(As while you may have defeated the incarnation of electric wrath itself, not even the power of friendship can defeat capitalism.)
|||(The End~)
