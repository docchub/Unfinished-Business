|||(Despite the recruiter’s warnings, you find yourself seeking out Nastasia.)
|||(The directions Corduroy gave you end up leading you into an abandoned graffiti plastered skate park.)
|||(Looking around, you see no sign of anyone else but yourself having been here. A small relief.)
|||(At a closer glance you notice one tag in particular amongst the graffiti that catches your eye.)
|||(Some gang called...)
|||(The Lil’ Pepperonis?)
|||(All their tags seem to be covering up some others you can’t make out.)
Nastasia|||Can I help you...
You|||WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
Nastasia|||Please shut up...
You|||I’m sorry that was extremely unprofessional.
Nastasia|||Oh... you’re with UB?
You|||Unfinished Business, at your service.
Nastasia|||Huh...
You|||Something wrong?
Nastasia|||No no. I’m just genuinely surprised they sent someone.
Nastasia|||You know what you’re getting into? Or did Corduroy finally stop giving a shit?
You|||No, they told me everything.
Nastasia|||Everything, huh? And you still came?
Nastasia|||I can’t decide whether you’re the coolest person I’ve ever met, or the most naive.
You|||Well I figure everyone deserves a second chance.
Nastasia|||Those second chances pile up my guy.
Nastasia|||Don’t forget to look out for yourself once and a while, yeah?
Nastasia|||I’ve had plenty of chances.
Nastasia|||Screwed up most of them.
Nastasia|||But thanks. I appreciate you not giving up on me.
You|||Just doing my job.
|||(Nastasia chuckles dryly.)
Nastasia|||Whatever you say.
|||(There’s an awkward pause. You hear the sound of traffic nearby.)
|||(Some guy is yelling about a bad parking job. It sounds like they bumped into whoever's car it was.)
|||(Judging from the siren. It sounds like it was your car...)
You|||So... Interview?
Nastasia|||I’ve got something I need to do now, but we can set something up later. Besides...
Nastasia|||It sounds like you’ve got something you need to deal with...
