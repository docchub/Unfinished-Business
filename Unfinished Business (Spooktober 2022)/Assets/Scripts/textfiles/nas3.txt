|||(That night, after you parted ways, you received a message from Nas, asking you to meet her for the interview.)
|||(She also sent pictures of all of her 11 dogs.)
|||(They are very cute.)
|||(Soon, the day of the interview came, and you went to meet Nas as usual by the skate park.)
Nas|nasNeutral|nasNeutral|You know what you’re doing?
You|||I’ll be fine I think.
You|||So long as you don’t throw me any curveballs.
Nas|nasUnimpressed||You know I think the person getting interviewed is supposed to be the nervous one normally.
You|||I don’t know, I’m pretty much set on letting you use me for the 24 hours.
You|||I guess I just want to know more about you at this point.
Nas|nasNeutral||I’ll bite, what do you want to know?
You|||Why do you only have one eye?
Nas|||Oh I got stabbed. 
Nas|||That what you were expecting?
You|||(NO)
You|||I guess more or less...
Nas|nasNeutral||I’m just joshin ya. I used to wear my hair to the side so it covered my eye.
Nas|||Guess that translated to my spectral form or whatever.
Nas|||Though I did *almost* get stabbed in the eye once...
Nas|||Pissed off that Louis kids’ parents.
Nas|nasUnimpressed||Mama Mia and Papa Louis they’re called.
Nas|||Owed them quite a bit of money at one point...
Nas|||My babies are not cheap.
Nas|nasNeutral||Not proud of it, but sometimes you have no other choice, yknow?
You|||(*screaming*)
You|||mhm. mhm.
You|||So that’s your unfinished business.
Nas|||Not exactly.
Nas|||You think I’m the type to worry about paying off people after I die?
Nas|nasUnimpressed||Hellllllll no.
Nas|||I need to make sure my babies are taken care of.
You|||Your dogs?
Nas|nasNeutral||I can’t leave until I know someone will take good care of them while I’m gone...
You|||If that’s all you needed, then why did you break the 24 hour policy so much?
Nas|||It just wasn’t enough time.
Nas|||I couldn’t give my pups a lifetime of care in 24 hours.
Nas|||And hell if I trust any of those randos from UB to take care of them after a few days of interviews.
Nas|||It was just easier to take care of them myself with a physical body.
You|||Still... you shouldn’t have stolen their bodies.
Nas|nasNeutral||I can tell you’ve never had pets.
You|||Either way, I still need to know you’re not going to steal my body if we sign together.
Nas|||If I promised you I wouldn’t, would you believe me?
You|||If I promised you I’d take care of them, would you believe me?
|||(There’s a silence...)
Nas|nasNeutral||Fuck I hate stalemates.
||empty|(It's then that you hear a shrill bark.)
|||(You and Nas turn to see two badass looking pizza themed mobsters.)
|||(Both of them are wearing an eyepatch that looks like pepperoni, and each of their suits have the pattern of a pizza.)
Nas|||Mama Mia... Papa Pia...
You|||Papa Pia?
Papa Louis|||Please, Papa Pia was-a my father.
|||(The man shared the same horrible voice and fake accent as the boy Louis.)
Mama Mia|||We just found these delectable little nuggets, and decided to bring them home.
|||(You can see clearly now, 11 chihuahua’s all held and balanced across the bodies of the two pizza mobsters.)
Nas|||Squeaky! Bilbo! Meep-Meep!
Nas|||They have my babies!
You|||Those don’t belong to you.
Mama Mia|||That’s-a where you’re wrong.
Mama Mia|||This is-a merely “collateral”.
Papa Louis|||We were-a owed. And so we are just-a takin what belongs to us.
Nas|nasNeutral||Oh hell no.
|||(Nas looks to you.)
Nas|||Lets fuck em up.
You|||I’m with you.
|||(Just then Nas phases into you.)
|||(You feel a sudden shock of cold, followed by a burning rage, as you are possessed by Nastasia.)
You + Nastasia|||Square the FUCK UP.
|||(The two of you raise your fists, ready for a fight.)
Mama Mia|||Normally square pizza’s are considered beneath us.
|||(She pulls out a set of nunchucks...)
Papa Louis|||But we can make an exception for junkie trash.
|||(He draws a katana with a flame pattern etched on the blade...)
Mama Mia|||Let’s-a go!
Nastasia|||YOU’RE .
Nastasia|||75% .
Nastasia|||IRISH!!!!!!!!!!
|||(You all rush forward, leaving the chihuahuas to witness the following carnage.)
|||(An epic battle ensues.)
|||(You and Nastasia take an early lead, delivering a devastating blow to Papa Pia, knocking the air out of him.)
|||(However, outnumbered, Mama Mia takes the opportunity to land a fury of blows on you.)
|||(Nastasia steadies you, as you begin to block stray attacks from Mia’s nunchucks.)
|||(Soon however, Papa Louis is back on his feet and makes a leaping attack at you.)
|||(You barely avoid the lethal blow, falling back into the skate pit.)
Mama Mia|||Give it up, you cannot-a beat us!
Papa Louis|||Who do you-a think you are?
|||(Nastasia brings you to your feet, blood dripping down from your forehead, and makes a sign with her hands.)
|||(She grins.)
|||(The sign of her old crew.)
|||(The mobsters are taken aback. Going wide eyed in that instance.)
|||(You take this moment to kick up a lopsided skateboard left behind here.)
Nas|||This is payback for everyone whose lives you ruined, you greasy pizza loving motherfuckers!!
|||(With an unnatural burst of speed, you rocket back and around, gaining momentum...)
|||(Together, you ride out of the pit, landing a kickflip on top of Papa Louis, before kicking the board into Mama Mia, knocking them both out instantly.)
|||(The chihuahuas chirp happily, celebrating your victory.)
|||(All 11 come running up to you, trying to lick your wounds.)
|||(You can’t help but smile as the tiny dogs swarm you.)
|||(However, in that moment you realize that Nastasia is no longer possessing your body.)
||nasNeutral|(You look over to see her floating behind you, watching the pups enamored with you.)
Nas|nasHappy||I think I trust you.
|||(You nod.)
You|||Are you sure you don’t want to play with them one more time?
|||(One of them licks your hand.)
Nas|||It would just make it harder...
Nas|nasFinal||Look after them ok. If I find out you haven’t, I’ll come back down and feed you to them myself.
||empty|(As she fades away you hear a few of the dogs whimper sadly. But you’re able to comfort them.)
|||(And not long after, Nastasia is gone.)
