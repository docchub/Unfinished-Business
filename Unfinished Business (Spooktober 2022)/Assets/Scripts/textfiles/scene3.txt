		|||(A wave of dust hits you as you step through the beat up old door and enter the makeshift offices of ‘Unfinished Business’.)
		|||(You watch as a bunch of ghosts float stationary while hovering above a few typewriters.)
		|||(Most of them seem to be broken or have keys missing.)
		|||(However, every once and a while you see one of the working keys mysteriously click by itself.)
		|||(There’s a quiet little cheer from the group each time this happens.)
Corduroy|coriNeutral|coriNeutral|Come on.
		|||(As you head to Corduroy’s office you notice the old shoebox they’d been carrying around when you ran into them last night.)
		|||(Inside the box are a number of ties!)
		||genericghost|(You see another small group of ghosts are trying to figure out how to tie them.)
		|||(They are not doing a very good job.)
You|||Here, let me help.
   |||(You quickly tie the knot. You are an expert at your craft.)

Ghost wearing a tie|||Thank you nice person.
You|||Anytime!
   |||(You smile, admiring your work before being pulled away by Corduroy.)
Corduroy|coriNeutral2|coriNeutral|So.
Corduroy|||Let me explain how this is going to work.
You|||Wait, already? Aren’t you supposed to give me an interview?
Corduroy|coriNeutral||No, see, from now on that’s your job.
You|||Wha-
Corduroy|coriNeutral2||Recently we’ve undergone some big changes here at Unfinished Business.
Corduroy|||And in accordance with the new guidelines... 
Corduroy|||Hosts and clients will be required to undergo an extensive interview process before any selections are to be made.
You|||Wait when those three said ‘host’ earlier I assumed this was some sort of restaurant thing? I’m not qualified to interview anyone!
Corduroy|coriNeutral||You’re about the only one who is qualified I’d say.
Corduroy|||I’ll start from the beginning.
Corduroy|||Unfinished Business’ mission is to send wandering spirits to the afterlife, or whatever lack thereof, by helping those with hangups in the living world.
Corduroy|||Your job in all this, is to find a compatible client to allow to possess your body so that they may complete their business
Corduroy|||and move on to whatever awaits them.
You|||Wait wait wait, possession?
Corduroy|coriNeutral2||The higher-ups have implemented a new 24 hour policy to make sure the clients can’t abuse their privileges.
Corduroy|coriAnnoy3||There was an... incident, which we don’t want to see repeated.
You|||What happened?
Corduroy|coriNeutral||So are you in, or out?
You|||That doesn’t…
Corduroy|coriNeutral2||Doesn’t matter to me. But I can tell you’re desperate.
You|||...
You|||Fine. What do I have to do?
		|||(Corduroy produces a clipboard and reading glasses.)
Corduroy|coriNeutral||Currently, the three clients at the top of the waitlist are Beverlee Buzzantine, Nastasia Ravenway, and one Michael S. Croft.
Corduroy|||Beverlee is at the top of the list, but don’t feel required to go to her first, or at all even.
Corduroy|||She has a reputation as one of our most difficult clients. Her hosts always complain about being bossed around and overall annoyed with her.
Corduroy|||There’s even a rumor she tried to pay a host in honey.
Corduroy|||So if you want to skip to the next client I don’t think anyone would question it.
		|||(Corduroy clears their throat before continuing.)
Corduroy|coriAnnoy||Next is Nastasia, that one I’d avoid entirely.
You|||How come?
Corduroy|coriNeutral2||She has a reputation for abusing, and even breaking the 24 hour policy.
Corduroy|||We’ve had more than a few hosts complain about her stealing their bodies for longer than agreed.
Corduroy|||And even with all that time, they haven’t been able to finish their business in the living world.
Corduroy|coriAnnoy2||I consider her a lost cause; if you value your time I would do the same.
You|||...
Corduroy|coriNeutral||Last one here...
Corduroy|||Michael is probably one of the easiest clients you could take here. All his hosts until now have given nothing but praise.
Corduroy|||Overall just a really nice guy from what I hear.
Corduroy|coriNeutral2||Still, it's strange he hasn’t moved on yet.
Corduroy|||But, if you’re looking for easy money, he’s the one to go for. And the one I’d personally recommend.
You|||All of them have had hosts before?
Corduroy|coriNeutral||These three have been with us for some time actually, Nastasia especially.
Corduroy|||She was a client here before the policy updates.
You|||So is it really just those three then?
Corduroy|coriAnnoy2||Unfortunately-
		|||(They say, speaking in air quotes)
Corduroy|coriNeutral2||Most of our other clients have either given up waiting and just wander around pointlessly now.
Corduroy|||I guess they hope they can forget what’s keeping them here if they distract themselves long enough.
Corduroy|||Most of the others working here actually have unfinished business in the living world too.
Corduroy|||They’ve gotten pretty comfy with how things are here though.
		|||(Corduroy clears their throat.)
Corduroy|coriNeutral||That’s the long and short of it though.
Corduroy|||So.
Corduroy|||Where do you want to start?
You|||Wait.
You|||Do you have unfinished business?
Corduroy|coriAnnoy||None that possessing some poor sack would help with.
Corduroy|||Now.
Corduroy|||We’ve got work to do.
		|||(You nod as Corduroy floats you the list of available clients.)
