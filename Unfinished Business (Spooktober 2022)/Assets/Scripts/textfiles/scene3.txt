||(A wave of dust hits you as you step through the beat up old door and enter the makeshift offices of ‘Unfinished Business’.)
||(You watch as a bunch of ghosts float stationary while hovering above a few typewriters.)
||(Most of them seem to be broken or have keys missing.)
||(However, every once and a while you see one of the working keys mysteriously click by itself.)
||(There’s a quiet little cheer from the group each time this happens.)
Corduroy||Come on.
||(As you head to Corduroy’s office you notice the old shoebox they’d been carrying around when you ran into them last night.)
||(Inside the box are a number of ties!)
||(You see another small group of ghosts are trying to figure out how to tie them.)
||(They are not doing a very good job.)
You||Here, let me help.
||(You quickly tie the knot. You are an expert at your craft.)
Ghost wearing a tie||W h o a a a a a a a a a a a a.
Other ghost wearing a tie||Thank you nice person.
You||Anytime!
||(You smile, admiring your work before being pulled away by Corduroy.)
Corduroy||So.
Corduroy||Let me explain how this is going to work.
You||Wait already? Aren’t you supposed to give me an interview?
Corduroy||No, see, from now on that’s your job.
You||Wha-
Corduroy||Recently we’ve undergone some big changes here at Unfinished Business.
Corduroy||And in accordance with the new guidelines, hosts and clients will be required to undergo an extensive interview process before any selections are to be made.
You||Wait when those three said ‘host’ earlier I assumed this was some sort of restaurant thing? I’m not qualified to interview anyone!
Corduroy||You’re about the only one who is qualified I’d say.
Corduroy||I’ll start from the beginning.
Corduroy||Unfinished Business’ mission is to send wandering spirits to the afterlife, or whatever lack thereof, by helping those with hangups in the living world.
Corduroy||Your job in all this, is to find a compatible client to allow to possess your body so that they may complete their business, and move on to whatever awaits them.
You||Wait, POSSESSION?
Corduroy||The higher-ups have implemented a new 24 hour policy to make sure the clients can’t abuse their privileges.
Corduroy||There was an... incident, which we don’t want to see repeated.
You||What happened?
Corduroy||So are you in, or out?
You||That doesn’t…
Corduroy||Doesn’t matter to me. But I can tell you’re desperate.
You||...
You||Fine. What do I have to do?
||(Corduroy produces a clipboard and reading glasses.)
Corduroy||Currently, the three clients at the top of the waitlist are Beverlee Buzzantine, Nastasia Ravenway, and one Michael S. Croft.
Corduroy||Beverlee is at the top of the list, but don’t feel required to go to her first, or at all even.
Corduroy||She has a reputation as one of our most difficult clients. Her hosts always complain about being bossed around and overall annoyed with her.
Corduroy||There’s even a rumor she tried to pay a host in honey.
Corduroy||So if you want to skip to the next client I don’t think anyone would question it.
||(Corduroy clears their throat before continuing.)
Corduroy||Next is Nastasia, that one I’d avoid entirely.
You||How come?
Corduroy||She has a reputation for abusing, and even breaking the 24 hour policy.
Corduroy||We’ve had more than a few hosts complain about her stealing their bodies for longer than agreed.
Corduroy||And even with all that time, they haven’t been able to finish their business in the living world.
Corduroy||I consider her a lost cause; I would do the same if you value your time.
You||...
Corduroy||Last one here...
Corduroy||Michael is probably one of the easiest clients you could take here. All his hosts until now have given nothing but praise.
Corduroy||Overall just a really nice guy from what I hear.
Corduroy||Still, it's strange he hasn’t moved on yet.
Corduroy||But, if you’re looking for easy money, he’s the one to go for. And the one I’d personally recommend.
You||All of them have had hosts before?
Corduroy||Well yeah, these three have been with us for some time actually, Nastasia especially.
Corduroy||She was a client here before the policy updates.
You||So is it really just those three then?
Corduroy||Unfortunately-
||(They say, speaking in air quotes)
Corduroy||Most of our other clients have either given up waiting and just wander around pointlessly now.
Corduroy||I guess they hope they can forget what’s keeping them here if they distract themselves long enough.
Corduroy||Most of the others working here actually have unfinished business in the living world too.
Corduroy||They’ve gotten pretty comfy with how things are here though.
||(Corduroy clears their throat.)
Corduroy||That’s the long and short of it though.
Corduroy||So.
Corduroy||Where do you want to start?
You||Wait.
You||Do you have unfinished business?
Corduroy||None that possessing some poor sack would help with.
Corduroy||Now.
Corduroy||We’ve got some work to do.
||(You nod as Corduroy floats you the list of available clients.)
