void
|||(Today is your day off.)
|||(A long week of helping lost souls move on has you thoroughly exhausted.)
|||(Sitting at home with your newly adopted 11 chihuahua’s you get a phone call from the office.)
|||(It seems the office ghosts finally figured out how the old rotary works.)
|||(Answering the call, you’re greeted by Corduroy on the other end.)
You|||Hello...?
Corduroy|||It has come to my attention that Ms. Buzzantine has withdrawn from the Unfinished Business program.
You|||Beverlee, she pulled out?
Corduroy|||Now while normally I wouldn’t care if a stray ghost slipped away, especially considering her manner, now isn’t the best time for this.
Corduroy|||At the moment we’re in the middle of a merger with some overseas operations in the ghost ascension business.
Corduroy|||We really need to land this thing, understand?
Corduroy|||The feds tracked down the stache of leprechaun gold we’ve been using to foot the bill, and without it we’re dead in the water.
Corduroy|||And I’m not talking about the human feds, I’m talking mega-feds. I’m talking about the lizard people.
Corduroy|||These are the folks who cracked mermaid watergate. They are single handedly responsible for the creation of astrology, understand?
Corduroy|||Did you know that all Scorpios are actually sleeper agents for these guys? Yeah, its pretty fucked up.
Corduroy|||Right now they have a monopoly on the undead market and are just waiting for us to slip up and take everything we’ve built.
Corduroy|||A high profile client like Beverlee jumping ship now?
Corduroy|||It puts the whole merger at risk.
Corduroy|||You need to find her and figure out her business NOW, or we’re all screwed.
|||(Corduroy has never shown more urgency for anything. This must be incredibly serious.)
You|||I’m on it boss.
Corduroy|||The fate of the company is in your hands. Good luck.
|||(You hang up the phone.)
You|||..........
|||(Half of what Corduroy said was gibberish to you, but you think it might be a good idea to look for Beverlee.)
|||(Still, after what happened last time, you’re unsure whether or not you’d be able to help her.)
|||(Not that you’d ever given much consideration to insect politics, but you don’t think it would be a good idea to throw the hive into disarray.)
|||(Especially considering that any unrest amongst the populous would reflect negatively on Unfinished Business.)
|||(The pixie republic would probably take issue with it or something...)
|||(Better not to risk anything.)
|||(Still... that doesn’t leave you with many options...)
|||(Your attention is pulled away by one of Nastasia’s dogs, Lieutenant Twinkletoes.)
Lieutenant Twinkletoes|||*bark* *bark*
|||(Hit by a sudden wave of inspiration you set off for the park, where you hoped to find Beverlee...)
|||(It's a cool night.)
|||(A gentle breeze chills you as you begin searching the grounds.)
|||(Moping in her usual spot, you find Princess Beverlee, alone.)
Bev|||Didn’t I tell you?
Bev|||I have no more use for you, peasant.
You|||Princess, listen, I think I can help you.
Bev|||Your “help” interests me very little, my naive friend.
Bev|||Leave me to wallow in my misfortune.
You|||I will do no such thing my lady.
Bev|||You dare speak back to your queen?
You|||I come offering a boon to your highness.
Bev|||What does the little man thing have to give me?
Bev|||If they’re promises of aid, and a blade in the back, I can spare you from having to draw your knife...
Bev|||You have quite the selection in fact.
Bev|||It seems both of us have felt its sting.
You|||I forgive you for what happened the other day.
Bev|||Then perhaps you are a stronger soul than I, peasant.
Bev|||Tell me, would you forgive my sister?
Bev|||Would you accept such a fate?
You|||I don’t think I can answer that.
|||(Beverlee nods.)
Bev|||I’ve decided I will not. Though I believe I will spare our people the retribution for her crimes.
Bev|||Unfortunately, this is against my nature, and something within me still thirsts for a throne.
Bev|||Perhaps mine is a path towards enlightenment. A practice in restraint.
Bev|||What say you, peasant? Could I become a proper wise woman?
You|||I cannot say, my lady. Though I believe I have a way to allow you to forgo this hero’s journey.
Bev|||What dost thou speak of?
You|||Follow me.
|||(You turn and walk towards your car. Beverlee follows curiously.)
|||(As you approach a cacophony of sneezing and other miscellaneous animal noises can be heard from inside the vehicle.)
|||(You throw the door open and watch as tumbling out, are Nastasia’s 11 chihuahua’s.)
|||(You see Lieutenant Twinkletoes, Squeaky, Bilbo, Meep-Meep...)
|||(Arthur, Pebbles, Merlin, Cpt. Yeehaw, Daniel Deathbringer, Fork, and Qwop.)
|||(Beverlee lets out a shriek of fear.)
Bev|||What treachery is this!
You|||Wait, it's not what you think!
|||(The dogs all gather at your feet, expectantly.)
Bev|||They’re hideous...
You|||As of today, they’re your new loyal subjects.
Bev|||But... just look at them...
|||(Qwop loses balance and falls on their side. Panting happily while cross eyed.)
You|||They need your guidance, my lady.
|||(Beverlee pauses, examining the vermin.)
|||(She turns to the lopsided Qwop.)
Bev|||You, sit up straight.
|||(Qwop sits obediently, his tongue stuck out, still cross eyed.)
|||(You see a twinkle in Beverlee’s eye...)
Bev|||You two, attend me. You in the back, you will be my steed. And you, bring me a nice dandelion.
|||(The dogs all begin skipping around the park merrily, following Beverlee’s commands. They quickly take a liking to her, and before long an hour has passed.)
Bev|||Oh this has been a delight!
Bev|||A queen could not ask for more wonderful subjects, oh!
|||(She cries out affectionately, landing on the nose of her steed, Lieutenant Twinkletoes.)
Bev|||I’ve never felt so alive!
|||(Small ethereal particles begin to fizzle off from Beverlee’s form.)
|||(It’s time.)
Bev|||Oh darn, I was hoping we could do this a little longer.
Bev|||Forever even...
Bev|||But I suppose such things are not meant to last.
|||(As she continues to disappear, Beverlee regards you one last time...)
Bev|||This would not have been possible without you.
Bev|||I suppose, peasant, that you deserve my thanks...
|||(You watch wordlessly as the former bee princess, now queen of the chihuahuas, vanishes from this world.)
You|||It was an honor...
