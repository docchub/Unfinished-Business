|||(A few days after your first meeting with Nastasia you were finally able to set up a date and time to have your interview.)
|||(You were warned that Nastasia was historically unreliable and hard to work with.)
|||(At first, you figured that was mostly due to her breaking the 24 hour policy like Corduroy said.)
|||(However, the past few days have probably been the most stressful of your life.)
|||(Not because of any existential threat of losing your body. No.)
|||(Nastasia has been the single hardest person to plan to meet with that you’ve encountered in your life.)
|||(Last time you met you exchanged contact info, and later that day you messaged her...)
You|||”Hi again, it's me, just checking in to see if you were still interested in setting up a day to have the interview?”
|||(The next day at 4 in the morning...)
Nastasia|||”aaaa I forgor”
You|||”That’s ok, what time are you free?”
|||(2 days later...)
Nastasia|||”akdljfsdg my bad dude”
Nastasia|||”was visiting some friends in sansburo”
Nastasia|||”totes blanked xD”
You|||”Again, that’s alright, I just need to know when we can meet up.”
|||(Later that night...)
Nastasia|||”Anytime works for me!”
You|||”Great, how about tomorrow morning?”
|||(The next afternoon...)
Nastasia|||”bro i felled aslepp”
|||(This continued for several more days until you finally just decided to go back to the skatepark to meet her yourself.)
|||(You walk in to see something unusual.)
|||(A number of teenage kids, all decked out in pizza themed roller blades, are busy doing all sorts of tricks around the place.)
|||(None of them are wearing helmets.)
You|||Hey, have any of you kids seen a ghost around here? One eye? Leaves you on read for a week?
Greasy Faced Skater Boy|||Hey, get out of here you old fart!
Greasy Faced Skater Boy|||We don’t have to tell you anything!
|||(The pimple-faced child laughs annoyingly.)
Kid Doing a Bad Accent|||Who letta this ravioli lookin mamma-mia into my-a fuckin park-a?
Greasy Faced Skater Boy|||You tell em, Louis!
Louis|||I dunno-a who you looking for, but if you don’t take-a your pizza pie out of here right-a now. We’re goin’fettuccine on your ass, penne.
You|||Please, I’m just looking for Nastasia!
Louis|||That scialatelli? What would you-a want with-a that soggy old-a pizza pie?
You|||She’s usually around here, I just want to talk to her!
Louis|||I’ll level with you penne, last I-a heard, she ate the big garganelli. Rest of-a her crew up and vanished after that.
Louis|||So this is-a our turf now, you comprehend-a?
You|||Yeah... I *comprehend*.
|||(The kids all laugh as you begrudgingly make your exit.)
|||(Once outside you see Nastasia looking bored and annoyed.)
You|||Were you watching here this whole time?
Nastasia|||Ugh, no. I just got back. Those Pepperoni kids are painful to look at. 
Nastasia|||I wouldn’t ‘watch’ them even if my life depended on it.
Nastasia|||They act all important because their leader Louis’ parents work for the mafia.
Nastasia|||But that voice...
Nastasia|||THEY’RE NOT EVEN ITALIAN
Nastasia|||AND IT'S NOT EVEN A GOOD ACCENT
Nastasia|||Anyway, what are you doing here?
You|||I’ve been trying to get in touch with you about the interview for days Nastasia!
Nastasia|||Eugh, just Nas please.
You|||Fine, but you haven’t given me anything to work with. 
You|||I need your help if we’re going to make this work.
Nas|||God finally, I was waiting for you to show a little backbone.
Nas|||Well, it's a start at least.
You|||Come on Nas, you’ve been avoiding this and you know it.
Nas|||...............
You|||Let me help you.
Nas|||Why do you think you’ll be any different from the others?
You|||I’m sorry?
Nas|||No one else has been able to help me.
Nas|||What makes you think you’re any different from them?
You|||I’m still here aren’t I?
Nas|||For how long, huh?
You|||Long as it takes.
You|||Just doing my job.
Nas|||...................................
Nas|||I guess we’ll see then.
|||(You breathe a sigh of relief.)
Nas|||I’m sorry for being a bitch about it. I can tell you really are trying to help.
You|||What’s bothering you? Why haven’t you been answering your phone?
Nas|||You know I wasn’t lying all the time, I actually was distracted a lot the last few days.
You|||What’ve you been doing?
Nas|||I have a few dogs. Back from when I was alive.
Nas|||It's hard to like this, but I still have to look after them.
You|||Wait, really that’s it?
Nas|||You’d be surprised how hard it is to get food for, walk, and feed 11 chihuahuas as a ghost.
You|||Wait wait wait wait wait, 11 chihuahuas?
Nas|||Is that weird?
You|||(YES)
You|||No I don’t think so...
Nas|||Oh good.
|||(She seems oddly relieved by that.)
Nas|||But yeah, I can do that interview now if you need.
You|||Uh........
You|||See the thing is I actually have to pick up my car from the shop now...
You|||They called me before I got here saying they fixed the dent.
Nas|||Who’s avoiding who now, huh?
You|||I-       
Nas|||I’m kidding, I know you wouldn’t do that.
Nas|||Go ahead, I’ll text you when I’ll be free next.
|||(The two of you both crack a smile as you part for the day.)
