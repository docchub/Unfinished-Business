void
|||(Your last encounter with Michael ended less than ideally. This seemed to have become a recurring theme of your time together.)
|||(You thought about going to Corduroy for advice, but decided against it.)
|||(After all, if Michael was supposedly the easiest client, then why was he giving you as much trouble as he was.)
|||(As much as he denied knowing it, it was clear Michael had something holding him back. Some unfinished business.)
|||(Whether out of concern, or some strange sense of obligation, you became determined to confront him regarding the matter.)
|||(Driving out to the suburbs you half expected to find the house empty.)
|||(It was either that or whatever family that lived there would be home instead.)
|||(However, to your surprise, you find the ghost Michael drifting passively watching the lit up house.)
You|||Michael...

MS|||How can I help, dear interviewer?
|||(His voice is strained.)
You|||What happened Michael? Who was that girl?
MS|||Oh that haha... Just someone I used to know.
You|||Your daughter...right?
MS|||yeah.......
You|||What’s her name?
MS|||Lucy.......
You|||You should talk to her. Possess me. I’ll help you.
MS|||What’s the point...?
MS|||I died so long ago, she was so young. She probably doesn’t even remember me.
MS|||Even if she does, what’s an apology almost a decade later going to matter?
MS|||I’ve already waited too long, there’s no point. I’ll just hurt her all over again.
You|||She still misses you, man.
You|||You didn’t see it but when she found your old game she almost started crying.
You|||You clearly still mean the world to her.
You|||It doesn’t matter how long it's been, people don’t just go away like that.
You|||Those memories stick with you.
You|||That kind of love doesn’t just disappear.
You|||It’s never too late to try...
|||(Michael sits with your words for a minute...)
|||(His face squints like he just downed 20 lemons, getting red, as he starts tearing up.)
|||(It would be almost comical...)
MS|||Fuck man :’)
|||(You hold your hand out for him.)
|||(He accepts your hand, and as you touch he begins to possess your body.)
|||(Together you knock on the door to the old house. The girl you saw the other day, Lucy, answers.)
|||(At first you’re worried that Michael will sound like a crazy person if he tries to say that you’re Lucy’s long lost father possessing the body of some rando.)
MS|||Family code 153, Gamma Sigma Trigonometry
|||(However, to your chagrin, it appears that their family has a protocol for this.)
Lucy|||Yo, did my dad actually possess you?
Lucy|||You’re not hurting them are you?
MS|||Nah, they have protocols and stuff. It's a whole bureaucracy :p
Lucy|||Daaaang. That sucks bro.
Lucy|||Is that...why you took so long to come back?
MS|||...No, I’m sorry Lulu. I was stupid and afraid and-
Lucy|||stopstopstopstop you’re gonna make me cry
MS|||Lu...
|||(She jumps at you, wrapping her arms around you. You can feel the tears moistening your shirt.)
|||(There’s also a good degree of snot.)
Lucy|||I don’t care if it's in a stranger’s body. I don’t care if they smell like old newspapers. And I don’t care if it's years later...
Lucy|||I’m just happy to see you again dad...
Lucy|||I’m so happy that you’re back...
MS|||Oh Lu... I can’t stay.
Lucy|||Why not?
|||(Sniffling, Lucy looks like she’s about to burst out in a full sob.)
MS|||It wouldn’t be fair to this person. It’s not my body.
MS|||Also the narcs made it so I can only borrow them for a day tops :p
|||(Lucy giggles through her tears at that.)
Lucy|||I don’t want you to go… :’))
MS|||I know Lu... I know… :’’’’))
MS|||I’m still not ready to say goodbye. But I guess I never really would be, huh. I’m sorry for making you wait so long.
Lucy|||Dad!
|||(A strange force of energy begins to lift off you, as it does you see a faint green glow coming off your body...)
|||(As the lights fade, Lucy wails.)
|||(You do your best to comfort her, as Michael S. Croft has passed on to the other side.)
|||(After some time you get up to leave. As you turn...)
Lucy|||Wait. Was it you that was playing “Dino Boxers: Conqueror”?
You|||Yeah... Me and Michael played together...
Lucy|||That was my favorite game as a kid.
Lucy|||I lost it after he passed away, I never actually got to beat it.
Lucy|||Always got stuck on the final boss :’)
|||(She chuckles, still sniffling.)
You|||You should check the save file again. I think your dad left you a little present there.
|||(You smile, waving, as the two of you part ways.)
|||(As you start your car and begin to drive off, you wonder if Lucy would be able to defeat the final boss.)
|||(During your playthrough Michael had insisted on only using the lower rank monsters, saying it was a “self imposed challenge”.)
|||(He also made a point of releasing any of your dinosaurs that went unconscious during a match.)
|||(Coming up to the final battle you only really had a few decent fighters left...)
|||(Come to think of it, you were still wondering what would happen to the imposter and the original Captain Yeehaw after they were revealed in the final fight...)
|||(You decided to buy a copy for yourself later...)
