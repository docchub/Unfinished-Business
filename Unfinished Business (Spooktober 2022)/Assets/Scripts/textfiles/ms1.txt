|||(At first you’re worried Corduroy was going to send you on a scavenger hunt across the city.) 
|||(However it turns out that Michael had been here waiting the whole time.)
||msNeutral|(You walk out to the lobby where you find the phantom deeply immersed in a game of “Blaze Insignia” for the ChintenmoTM 4qs.)
|||(He’s currently crossing his non-existent fingers, hoping for good luck.)
|||(You peer over his shoulder to see an enemy unit about to attack one of his. It looks as if even one hit will finish them off.)
|||(The enemy unit lands their strike, and with a sigh, you watch as Michael hard reboots the system.)
You|||Hey, why’d you turn it off? You looked pretty close to the end of the level.
MS|msHappy||Whoa, hey gamer!
MS|||I can tell you’ve never played “Blaze Insignia” before.
You|||I’m more of a “Creature Junction” person.
MS|msConf||I’ll say xD
MS|||You’re Corduroy’s new host, ya? 
MS|||Yknow, I have a bunch more of these games back at my place if you wanna come hang?
You|||You don’t want to do the interview?
MS|msNeutral||Nah, I was thinking we just ditch that whole thing.
MS|||I can still pay you if you want though.
You|||That’s alright...
MS|||So whaddya say gamer? You in, or you pressin’ X for out?
You|||Can we at least do the interview after?
MS|msHappy||yeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeahyeah totally
MS|||now cmon, lets go
|||(So together you and Michael traveled across town. Following his directions you come to a small home outside the city limits.)
|||(This was a longer trip than you expected...)
MS|msSad||Are we there yet?
You|||We literally just got inside, Michael please.
MS|msNeutral||                :0
You|||This was your house before you died?
|||(Looking around, you see what appears to be a collection of family photos, but before you can take a closer look, MS floats in front of you.)
MS|msMad3||bro I dig that you’re excited to snoop around and all, but we gotta get this party rocking before I die from boredom
You|||Why are you in such a hurry?
MS|msHappy2||shhh shhh shhh, less talk, more find where I left my spare ChintenmoTM
|||(The ghost leaves in a sprint. Or at least what you imagine a ghost sprinting would look like.)
|||(You can’t help but imagine Michael’s ghost body with realistic human legs.)
|||(An unpleasant thought.)
|||(It doesn’t take long though before you hear shouting from the basement as Michael locates the misplaced console.)
MS|msHappy||Alriiiiight, I got the stuff. Come and sit down, we’ve got beanbags :D
|||(The two of you spend the next few hours immersed in the gameplay of what Michael claims to be his favorite game...)
|||(“Dino Boxers: Conqueror”)
|||(It combines a surprisingly engaging story with intense dinosaur VS dinosaur gameplay.)
|||(In it your character raises dinosaurs alongside their friends as they all compete in a tournament to see who’s the strongest Dino Boxer.)
|||(Your rival in the game starts out as some self important rich kid, but turns out to be a pretty cool guy once you beat him and show him that he still has a ways to go.)
|||(You and Michael get a few hours into the game before you realize how much time has passed.)
You|||Did you still want to have the interview?
MS|msReally||Ehhhh not tonight.
You|||Really? Are you sure?
MS|msNeutral||Sure as the shore.
MS|||I’m honestly not even really interested in moving on.
You|||Why are you even at Unfinished Business in the first place then?
MS|msMad2||Ah come on don’t make me say it. It gets lonely being dead for so long.
MS|||Not @everyone can see and talk to us like you can. And much less want to actually spend time with us.
You|||Why not have other ghosts for company?
MS|msNeutral||Some of the fresher dead still haven’t learned how to interact with the physical world as well.
MS|||Makes it harder to play games with someone if they can’t even use the controller.
You|||Yeah I guess that could get pretty lonely.
|||(You pause for a moment.)
You|||So what is your unfinished business anyway? Why are you still here?
MS|msConf||idk lol
You|||I’m serious, what is it?
MS|msNeutral||Sorry pal, I got no idea.
You|||So you’re just stuck here then?
MS|msHappy2||Sure, yeah, whatever you say. It's not all that bad though.
MS|||If you ask me, everyone else is stupid for trying to leave. I mean...
You|||What...?
MS|msSad||I mean you don’t know what’s on the other side? How can you?
You|||You don’t believe in an afterlife?
MS|msNeutral||I believe in this life, and I’m gonna make the most of it while I still damn well can.
|||(Despite Michael’s words, there’s an insecurity. Something in his voice that tells you he’s running from something.)
You|||...
MS|msHappy2||Well that’s all folks.
You|||I’m sorry?
MS|msConf||It's about time for you to leave, besides I don’t want to take away from the clients with actual work for you to do.
|||(Nodding, you collect your things, and begin to leave.)
|||(On your way you almost catch another glimpse at the family pictures you saw on your way in, before...)
MS|msHappy||Thanks again for coming, drive safe!
|||(You nod, exit the house, and head back to the city.)
