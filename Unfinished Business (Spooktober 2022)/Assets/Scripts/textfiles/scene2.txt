void
			  |||(You stand before an old beaten down looking bookstore. Double checking the directions on the pamphlet, it doesn’t seem like you’re in the wrong place.)
			  |||You almost decide to leave before looking down to see a cardboard sign out front that reads: ‘Unfinished Business’ in messy chicken scratch.)
			  |||(You see in smaller handwriting beneath it...)
Cardboard Sign|||‘Sorry for the bad sign.’
Cardboard Sign|||‘Our usual sign guy called out sick today.’
Cardboard Sign|||‘He likes to hold it up and dance around with it, so we put it on the ground today in solidarity.’
Cardboard Sign|||’We would’ve put it at half mast but we ran out of tape.’
			  |||(You can tell whoever wrote this started their letters too big, as the majority of the note is squished into the side of the sign.)
You|||Maybe this was a mistake…
   |||(Just before you can turn away, you hear a number of whispering voices from inside start to gather.)
Whispering Guy #1|||Is that a client?
Whispering Guy #2|||I think it's a host.
Whispering Guy #1|||Nah we don’t have those.
Whispering Guy #3|||Yeah, Unfinished Business hasn’t had a host in...uhh
Whispering Guy #3|||uh.............................
Whispering Guy #1|||A realllllllllllllllly long time.
Whispering Guy #2|||They’re clearly alive though. And they’re staring right at us.
Whispering Guy #1|||Nonono, see. They're probably just lost and uhmm....
Whispering Guy #1|||Admiring the architecture...?
Whispering Guy #3|||These are just the things you pick up on from years of experience, rookie.
You|||Hello? Is this Unfinished Business?
Whispering Guy #2|||Told you.
Whispering Guy #1 + #3|||Beginner’s luck.
You|||Are you taking applications for hosts at the moment? 
You|||If not I’m absolutely willing to wait until one of the current hosts or hostesses leave and the position opens up.
Guy #1||tieghost|Uh you’ll wanna talk to Corduroy about that. They’re the head of recruitment.
You|||When can I meet them?
   ||coriNeutral|(Phasing through the door at that moment is the same strange mascot character you saw last night.)
   |||(It also dawns on you in this moment that this person never had legs, and has just been floating around.)
You|||HOW’D YOU DO THAT?
|||(They gesture to their body, or lackthere of.)
You|||Ok, see, I don't believe in ghosts... so-
Corduroy|coriAnnoy||Believe it or not reality has a habit of making itself known to those who turn their eye from it.
You|||Wow, I can't believe I'm meeting a genuine poltergeist.
Corduroy|coriMad||I am NOT a poltergeist.
		|||(Something seems to have deeply offended them.)
Corduroy|||I am NOT some common spirit getting off on stealing bodies, or some wash-up poltergeist knocking things over for fun.
Corduroy|coriNeutral||I. Am a Raiju.
Corduroy|||A mythological lightning beast.
Guy #3||tieghost|They get kind of angry around electricity so we have to keep the lights off when they’re in the building.
Guy #1||genericghost|Not like we could afford the bill anyway, so it's a win-win!
You|||Beast? Like the ghost of a dog or something?
Corduroy|coriAnnoy|coriNeutral|No.
You|||Can I pet you?
Corduroy|coriAnnoy||We’re getting off track. Did you want the job or not?
You|||Sorry sir, yes please.
Corduroy|coriNeutral||Fantastic.
		|||(They do not seem thrilled.)
Corduroy|coriNeutral2||Come inside.
