|||(Following your previous excursion with the game freak, you plan to meet Michael at their home in the suburbs.)
|||(You were a little hesitant to reach out with how your last meeting with them ended, but when you did they seemed eager to continue “Dino Boxers” with you.)
|||(When you arrive, Michael is ecstatic.)
MS|||EXCELLENT!
You|||Tubular...?
MS|||Most rooiiiighteous!!!
You|||Baller.
MS|||GOATED with the awesomesauce~
You|||Cringe.
MS|||You must kill your inner cringe. Namaste.
|||(Eventually the two of you go down to the basement to continue the game of “Dino Boxers: Conquerors”.)
|||(Together with Michael’s guidance, you reach the finals of the tournament.)
|||(It was a difficult road. Your mentor, Captain Yeehaw, midway through the game betrayed you.)
|||(It was revealed that the real Captain Yeehaw had been replaced by an evil monster.)
|||(It also turned out that the antagonist of the game up until this point, Mr. Bones, had actually been the real Captain Yeehaw trying to stop the fake.)
|||(You had to admit not even you were expecting this twist.)
|||(Now at the end of the game, all that’s left to do is defeat the impostor, and claim your title as the Dino Box Champion.)
|||(Just before you can start the final battle however...)
MS|||Hey, what time is it?
|||(You check the clock on the console.)
You|||Says it's about 4.
|||(You hear the door upstairs unlock, open and close.)
MS|||Shit you need to get out, now.
You|||Wait why, what’s wrong?
MS|||Just go! NOW!
MS|||Climb out through the window!
You|||Why can’t I just go upstairs? I thought this was your house?
MS|||Listen, she can’t see you here. Please just go.
You|||Shit...
|||(You clear off the many box sets of various anime and shows about people in spandex on a spaceship and climb out the window.)
|||(Michael looks up to you as you step out.)
MS|||I’m really sorry about this, I’ll make it up to you though I promise, ok?
|||(You hear a girl’s voice from upstairs.)
Girl|||Hellooooo? Ma, you there?
|||(MS panics and starts trying to fly out and phase through the walls, but forgets he’s holding the ChintenmoTM.
|||(It smacks against the window and falls back on the bean bag chairs where you were sitting.)
|||(You both look back down through the window looking in on the basement and watch as a girl in her early teens wanders down and picks up the console.)
|||(She looks confused at first, glancing around the room, you duck out of the way.)
|||(You and Michael watch then as she opens and turns on the device, as it lights up her eyes go wide.)
Girl|||Dad...?
|||(The girl is stifling tears looking at the handheld game console.)
|||(You go to speak to Michael, but he’s nowhere to be seen.)
|||(Left with no other choice, you decide to call it a night and drive back to the city...)
