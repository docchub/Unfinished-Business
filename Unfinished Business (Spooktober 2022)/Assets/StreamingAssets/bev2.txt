|||(A few days following your initial interview with Beverlee, you decide to make good on your obligations, and return to the park to meet her.)
|||(Maybe with time to think, she’d come up with a better solution.)
Bev||bevNeutral|I WANT YOU TO HELP ME BURN THAT BITCH’S NEST TO THE GROUND

You|||I’m sorry, could you say that again?
Bev|bevNeutral||The lady will NOT repeat herself.
Bev|||If I cannot be queen, then my sister’s kingdom shall burn.
Bev|bevMad||A heavenly inferno of divine vengeance. This we shall bring down upon them.
You|||I don’t know if that’s a great idea...
Bev|bevNeutral||They’re merely insects to you are they not?
Bev|||It should be no trouble as I understand it.
You|||What about your unfinished business? If you can’t be queen you’ll be stuck here won’t you?
Bev|||Perhaps, but I fear my heart will never know peace until that harlot queen rests buried in the dirt.
You|||What’d she do that upset you so much?
Bev|bevMad||Have you gone deaf, or are you merely as donkey brained as I’d first believed?
Bev|||They have certificates for that, you know.
Bev|||My sister exiled me, forced me out of my home!
You|||But before that, you must’ve been close, right?
Bev|||HA! Such a notion is obscene.
Bev|bevNeutral||That wench has always been trying for my throne, ever since we were but a drop of nectar on our father’s wing.
Bev|||She is beyond any redemption. Much less my *forgiveness* as you insinuate.
You|||But what if-
Bev|||BUT NOTHING
Bev|bevMad||You forget your place, peasant.
Bev|||Enough of these pleasantries. You will be my sword, whether you like it or not.
|||(In that moment the spectral bee dashes at you with unnatural speed. You barely manage to avoid her before she changes her trajectory and slams into your back.)
||empty|(You feel a rush of cold, as Beverlee has taken control of your body.)
Bev|bevMad||Eugh, I will never grow used to these lumbering sacks of meat.
|||(You feel your control of your body pushed out of reach, your consciousness pushed to the back of your mind- )
|||(-sinking further and further away as Beverlee exerts her will.)
|||(Beverlee turns to a nearby tree, and you realize that within it is a massive beehive.)
|||(Eying the hive, Beverlee finds a large stone off the ground.)
|||(However, as she goes to grab it you hear a yipping bark.)
|||(A small dog on a leash running from its owner to inspect you.)
Friendly Chihuahua|||*yip* *yip*
|||(Beverlee shrieks, absolutely terrified.)
||bevNeutral|(You feel the drowning sensation leave your body as Beverlee flees the cute little mangy beast, no longer possessing you.)
You|||Bev wait-
|||(The small dog pulls your attention back to it. You pet them. The puppy chirps pleased before you run off in pursuit of Beverlee.)
|||(Chasing after Beverlee you find her resting on the seat of the swingset the two of you first met.)
|||(She looks up at you ashamed...)
You|||What the hell was that back there?
You|||Why did you steal my body?
You|||And what was with that dog?
|||(You see now that the scorned bee princess is fully ugly crying.)
Bev|bevSad||You wouldn’t understand. 
Bev|||No one understands.
Bev|||That sort of betrayal... 
Bev|||I’m a good person.
Bev|||I’m a good person.
Bev|bevSad2||I’m a good person, right?
Bev|||I don’t deserve this, ... right?
|||(Stunned, you find yourself at a loss for words.)
Bev|||I must seem like a loon.
You|||Not at all princess...
|||(Hesitantly, you slowly dip into a curtsy.)
You|||What troubles you my liege?
|||(She looks up, seeming to appreciate the gesture.)
Bev|bevSad||When I was exiled, I didn’t last long on my own...
Bev|||Almost as soon as I was thrown out.
Bev|||A mangy imp...
Bev|||A dog just like that ate me.
Bev|||That’s how I died.
Bev|||Or at least that’s what I thought would happen, I stung the poor thing’s mouth a few too many times.
Bev|||I fell soon after.
Bev|||Is there not a more shameful end for a princess of the hive?
|||(She looks longingly at the tree in which her hive had made their home.)
You|||Bev, why did you possess me like that? What the hell were you thinking?
You|||We could have worked something out.
You|||This was just wrong...
Bev|bevFinal1||I just wanted to be queen... is that really so wrong?
|||(There’s a tense silence...)
Bev|||You should return to your office, peasant. There is no more you can do for me... 
||empty|(Lacking the heart to stay, you part ways with Princess Beverlee, and return to the offices at Unfinished Business.)
